\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}
Feedback through the usage of \boatvone\  while annotating \bountreebank{} made it clear that making a tool for a network of annotators collaborating on a single treebank would facilitate creating higher quality treebanks.
Accordingly, a web application would fit this purpose and it was implemented as such.
Using a database, rather than working with \conllu{} files, makes it feasible to implement search facilities.
At the end, dockerizing it makes it accessible and easily testable.

We hope this tool will be used for dependency parsing treebanks and also believe it can be used for other purposes as well with slight changes.
We plan to include the tool on Bogazici University Computer Engineering Department's webpage for NLP.
