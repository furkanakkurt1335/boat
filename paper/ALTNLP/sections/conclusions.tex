\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we aimed to develop a web-based dependency annotation tool for the MRL Turkish with a focus on annotators' user experience towards creating quality treebanks. 
We performed in-depth interviews with annotators who were linguists to gather the requirements. 
A web-based annotation tool was designed in accordance with modern software development tools and approaches. 
The tool was developed with an API to enable alternative utilization of the annotations and annotation process. 
The tool is containerized for easy delivery and deployment. 
We are encouraged by the development of this tool and anticipate its extensions as well as the development of similar tools. 
This tool is in testing phase with encouraging feedback. It will be made available as a demo and a downloadable resource from 
the Boğaziçi University Natural Language Resources Platform~\cite{DIP}.
