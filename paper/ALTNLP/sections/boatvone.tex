\section{BoAT-v1}
\label{sec:boatvone}

\boatvone~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish} is a standalone annotation tool for treebanks compatible with the \ud\ framework~\cite{UD}.
It uses Python~\cite{python} and Qt~\cite{qt} for the user interface.
Although mouse-based interaction is supported, for almost all functionality, keyboard input is supported in accordance with annotators' demands.
It was used to create the \bountreebank~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish,turk2021resources,UD-Boun-Treebank} -- a manually annotated Turkish dependency treebank comprising close to 10 thousand sentences.
It uses analyzers to process treebanks in the dependency annotation format of \ud\ called \conllu.
It supports the annotation of a single treebank at a time and the annotations are stored in a \conllu\ file, which is updated as annotations are made.

The work presented in this paper (\boatvtwo) is based on the experiences gained during the use of \boatvone\ in treebank creation.
Like its predecessor and many other tools, it supports \ud.
The primary interaction modality is the keyboard to enable a flow state.
It is a web application with a backend that provides an API.
A database is used for persisting the annotations created by various annotators for various treebanks.
It provides rich search functionality that supports collaborative annotations.
It is an open-source resource that is containerized for ease of distribution and deployment.
