\section{Requirements and Design}
\label{sec:requirements}

In-depth interviews and requirements elicitation with annotators that have annotated the \bountreebank{}, which has close to 10 thousand sentences, have been conducted to elicit the software requirements.
This section will explain the requirements elicited during the aforementioned process and design decisions based on them.

\begin{itemize}[before=\normalfont, font=\itshape, align=left]
\item[Search:]
An annotator should be able to search the treebank they are a part of to see other annotations done for a specific sentence.
Annotators sometimes struggle with a specific sentence's annotation and want to be able to search for specific annotations linguistically similar to the one they are currently doing to make the treebank consistent within itself and reduce their cognitive load in general.
They should be able to search the treebanks in a complex way, by several fields at the same time, such as UD tags, features or plain text.

\item[Focus:]
The annotation process requires a great deal of attention, therefore, the main priority is to improve the user experience for an annotator so that they can more efficiently produce accurate annotations.
Annotators use the tools sometimes for hours on end.
Software should make the work easier by reducing distractions and automating tasks.
One of the requirements we have gathered for facilitating the focus of an annotator is for the software to offer keyboard input for every task.
An annotator should not have to use a mouse for any type of task.
Offering keyboard shortcuts for most or all tasks is required for a keyboard-oriented approach.

\item[Autocompletion:]
Since annotators lose focus after some time naturally, automating and the validation of the entries are high priorities in this respect.
Many UD tags have predefined sets of values.
Autocompletion should be provided for such UD tags, reducing errors and increasing efficiency.

\item[Clutter:]
Using the screen space in a compact manner is also important for focus and any part of the screen that's not interacted with frequently should be made compact.
Considering this, the previous application's checkboxes, responsible for toggling columns of the table, have been converted into a dropdown menu, leaving more space for the annotation table where most of the annotator's focus is directed towards.

\item[API:]
Another requirement is an API for search and annotation functionalities.
In addition to using the API for the UI generation, a 3rd party agent also should be able to use the API to get the annotations of a particular treebank to use in their NLP tasks in a systematic way.
This opens up many possibilities for the use of the tool beyond the annotator's UI experience.

\item[Docker:]
Following good software practices, this tool should be dockerized and made available as open source.
This means that the tool is is easily deployable and accessible.
\end{itemize}
