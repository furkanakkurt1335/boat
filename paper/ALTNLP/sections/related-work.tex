There are many tools for annotation but many of them use a hybrid approach regarding keyboard and mouse usage.
For example, \textit{brat} is an open source project for text annotation on browsers, mostly based on mouse clicks~\cite{brat,UD}.
There are other third-party tools presented in the UD tools webpage such as \textit{UD Annotatrix}~\cite{tyers-etal:2018} and \textit{DgAnnotator}~\cite{dgannotator}.
These tools are similar to \textit{brat} in mouse usage.
\textit{DgAnnotator} is also specifically for creating dependency trees and adding dependency relations.
\textit{UD Annotatrix} is, as the name implies, a tool for UD treebanks.
Some tools have also been developed for specifically Turkish treebanks~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish}.

\boatvone~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish} is a standalone application with a keyboard-oriented approach, but it lacks a network for annotators.
The annotation done on \bountreebank{} by this tool and the feedback that came of that work indicates that keyboard-only approach is more efficient and takes less time for creating treebanks.
It was implemented for treebanks using the UD framework.
We try to improve on and add new features to this tool in this paper, while making it available on the web.
