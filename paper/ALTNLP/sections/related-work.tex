There are numerous annotation tools, most of which rely on mouse-based interactions.
For example, \textit{brat} is an open source project for text annotation on browsers, mostly based on mouse clicks~\cite{brat,UD}.
There are other third-party tools presented in the UD tools webpage such as \textit{UD Annotatrix}~\cite{tyers-etal:2018} and \textit{DgAnnotator}~\cite{dgannotator}.
These tools are similar to \textit{brat} in mouse usage.
\textit{DgAnnotator} is also specifically for creating dependency trees and adding dependency relations.
Some tools have also been developed for specifically Turkish treebanks~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish}.
For example, the ITU Treebank Annotation Tool~\cite{pamay-etal-2015-annotation} has been used for creating Turkish treebanks.
It relies on mouse clicks and not related to the UD format.

\boatvone~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish} is a standalone application with a keyboard-oriented approach, but it lacks a network for annotators.
It displays the annotation table and a dependency graph used by UD~\cite{UD} together for a given sentence.
The annotation done on \bountreebank{} by this tool and the feedback that came of that work indicates that keyboard-only approach is more efficient and takes less time for creating treebanks.
It was implemented for treebanks using the UD framework.
We try to improve on and add new features to this tool in this paper, while making it available on the web.
