There are many tools for annotation but many of them use a hybrid approach regarding keyboard and mice usage.
For example, brat is an open source project for text annotation on browsers.\cite{brat}\cite{UD}
There are other third-party tools presented in the UD tools webpage such as UD Annotatrix\cite{tyers-etal:2018} and DgAnnotator\cite{dgannotator}.
DgAnnotator is specifically for creating dependency trees and adding dependency relations.
UD Annotatrix is, as the name implies, a tool for UD treebanks.
It's a mouse-oriented tool, using clicks.

BoAT v1~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish}, is a standalone application.
It has a keyboard-oriented approach, but it lacks a network for annotators.
The annotation done on the BOUN Treebank and the feedback that came of that work indicates that keyboard-only approach is more efficient and takes less time for creating treebanks.
It was implemented for treebanks using the UD framework.
This tool has been used to annotate the entire BOUN Treebank.
We try to improve on and add new features to this tool in this paper, while making it available on the web.
