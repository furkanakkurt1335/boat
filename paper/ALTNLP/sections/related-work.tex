There are many tools for annotation but many of them use a hybrid approach regarding keyboard and mouse usage.
For example, brat is an open source project for text annotation on browsers, mostly based on mouse clicks.\cite{brat}\cite{UD}
There are other third-party tools presented in the UD tools webpage such as UD Annotatrix\cite{tyers-etal:2018} and DgAnnotator\cite{dgannotator}.
These tools are similar to brat in mouse usage.
DgAnnotator is also specifically for creating dependency trees and adding dependency relations.
UD Annotatrix is, as the name implies, a tool for UD treebanks.
Also, tools have been developed for specifically Turkish treebanks.\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish}

\boat{} v1~\cite{turk-etal-2019-turkish} is a standalone application with a keyboard-oriented approach, but it lacks a network for annotators.
The annotation done on the entire \bountreebank{} by this tool and the feedback that came of that work indicates that keyboard-only approach is more efficient and takes less time for creating treebanks.
It was implemented for treebanks using the UD framework.
We try to improve on and add new features to this tool in this paper, while making it available on the web.
