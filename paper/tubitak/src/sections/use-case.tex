A typical annotation can proceed as follows:
An annotator selects a sentence from a treebank.
An annotation table appears with the sentence parsed according to the \ud\ format.
Each row corresponds to a token and its annotations.
Figure~\ref{fig:anno-fig} shows the annotation view while an annotator is annotating a Turkish sentence ``Sel sularında neler yoktu ki...'' (translation: \textit{What wasn't in the flood waters...}).

An annotator can make use of dependency graphs, errors, and search during annotation.
Dependency graphs are visual cues for how lemmas are dependent upon one another.
Errors are helpful reminders compliant with \ud.
Search can help the annotator disambiguate ambiguous forms, or check previously annotated sentences to ensure coherency and inter-annotator agreement.
The annotator can search for previously made annotations in combinations of text and feature values.

Annotators can customize the columns and dependency graph in accordance with their preferences.
They can hide and view columns as they prefer, and they can choose from several different dependency graph styles.
When an annotation is finished, its status can be set to ``Complete''.
