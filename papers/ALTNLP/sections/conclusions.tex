\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

In this work, we aimed to develop a web-based dependency annotation tool for agglutinative languages with a focus on annotator user experience in order to create quality treebanks.
We performed interviews with annotators for the requirements.
A web-based annotation tool was designed in accordance with modern software development tools and approaches.
It was developed with an API to enable alternative utilization of the annotations and annotation process, and is containerized for easy delivery and deployment.
We are encouraged by the development of this tool and anticipate its extensions as well as the development of similar tools.
This tool is in testing phase with encouraging feedback.
It will be made available on the Boğaziçi University's language plafform DIP~\cite{DIP}.
