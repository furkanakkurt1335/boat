Treebanks are sets of sentences annotated manually by linguists or first automatically and then refined by linguists. They are used in many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. The problem is creating quality treebanks. There are annotation tools for facilitating the creation of such treebanks. Even by tools crafted with linguists in mind, the annotation task is hard work and tends to require consistent attention. These tools should be further refined according to user, who are linguists in this case, feedback in order to increase efficiency and reduce cognitive load of annotators.
