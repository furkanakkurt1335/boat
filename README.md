# BoAT

A Collaborative Web Tool for Linguistic Annotation. The project was started as part of my senior project for the course CMPE492. It is still being improved. The project details can be found [here](https://furkanakkurt1335.github.io/projects/boat).

## Description

This project has been developed for improving the already-existing standalone annotation tool [here](https://github.com/boun-tabi/BoAT) called BoAT and creating a collaborative web application for it. The standalone tool is also improved and put under the folder `app-qt` in this repository. It was based on Qt and written in Python. The web application is also written in Python with the Django framework.
